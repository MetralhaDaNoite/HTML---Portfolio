<h3>Friday</h3>

<p>This is a really funny movie featuring ice cube and chris tucker</p>

<h3>Ender's Game</h3>

<p>This movie is really intersting and explores the idea of training gifted children to fight in a preemptive attack against an alien species that had attacked earth before</p>

<h3>Hamilton</h3>

<p>I dont know if this counts as a movie but its a musical about the life and story of Alexander Hamilton</p>
