    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>DOCUMENT CONTROLLER/ASSISTANT SITE MANAGER • HENRYS • APRIL 2020 – NOVEMBER 2021</h3>

        I have been performing normal labor duties while gaining some hands-on site experience. While working here I also took on some supervisor roles at times due to previous experience I was able to organize the other labors, I would take deliveries of the panels we were installing onsite, I was also trusted with locating and transporting the panels from our storage units and up to where our fixers where working on the scaffolding (this helped me and my ability to read construction drawings, as well as getting the other labors to work as a unit)</p>
        
        <h3>LOGISTICS OPERATIVE • LIDER/YUANDA • FEBRUARY 2023 – MARCH 2023</h3>
